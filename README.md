# Stolen funds DeFi vs CeFi


## Project description:
This data analysis project will investigate the total value stolen/lost in the traditional financial space vs the crypto space within a 5-year time span and try to determine which of the two are you most likely to loose funds in.
    
    
## Gather sources and Data:
with the sources we will imput the required data.the data will have to be ready for coding. The required libraries(Visual) will be imported and used, once libraries are imported we can begin by folowing the Tasks:
-Clean the Dataset
-Tally the Sum of the funds stolen
-identify the countries mostly affected by the Hacks
-display the data using bar graphs, geo mapping and other libraries
-given the data, explain safer ways to safeguard your assets
as the data and code are been rendered and graphs and visualizations are shown for the data, the similarities and differences can be calculated for crypto currencies over Traditional Banking and other aspects of the research.


## Research Questions:
As we are desiminating the data, we will ask the following questions base on the obtain results:
-Are you most likely to have your funds stolen in crypto over traditional banking?
-what are the countries mostly targeted by these attacks?
-Are these attacks mostly done by Unknown Groups or Named Groups?


## Data Completion and Results:
As we we complete inputing the data and rendered the visualizations required and obtain our results we will ask the following closing questions:
-How Susceptible are Cryptocurrencies and Banks to Attacks?
-Which are the most common Types of Attacks shared amongst both?
-Based on the data, are the attacks on cryptocurrencies and banking ,Tied to a certain 
individual or group/Nation?
-Is the Average of the total amount of Funds lost from crypto to Traditional banking 
significant enough to convey confidence from one of the other? 
-Amongst both of the two systems, based on the research? Which of the two conveys 
more confidence for the future of banking?

Once all our data has been process and inputed, create all our required visualizations, and DataFrames we will check for any errors or missing parts of code or sections and make sure is ready to present and pused to our Project repository, completed Read.me file, and sources. for grading and make our presentation tot the class.
